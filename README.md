<strong>Project Title - Advance Traffic Management System Using Google Cloud </strong><br>
The major goal of the project is to make traffic management systems work dynamically using the Internet of Things, Infrared sensors in order to make the traffic systems work efficiently. Traffic management automation systems in the market aim to computerized the traffic lights operates on the periodic to control the light (red/green) uses various technologies like GSM, NFC focuses on the basic operation of an electrical switch. Our project plan to provide an automated IR-sense based solution that makes traffic signals to shift the lights (red/green) dynamically. We plan on implementing the project for one junction “proof-of-concept”, which includes traffic lights, IR-sensors, Wi-Fi transmitters, and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers. The sensed data gathered from the IR sensor is transmitted by the Wi-Fi transmitter which is received by the raspberry-pi controller. Based on this compilation it dynamically shifts the time of the red signal and the user gets an intimation of the status of the signal on his way. The Raspberry Pi controller works as a central console, it determines which sideways of the road signal is to get open or close. The central console gathers all the data from sensors and stores it in the cloud which intimates traffic status to a mobile device and finally providing a way to the ambulance.
